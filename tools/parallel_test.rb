# Shard the test suite across processes for `rake test:parallel`, and report the
# whole thing as if it were one serial run.
#
# A COPY of the framework's own runner. ruby-gba keeps it in tools/, which its gem
# does not ship, so a game built on the framework cannot require it — and this suite
# wants exactly the same thing from it. Kept in step by hand, which is seldom needed.
#
# Threads would be the cheaper option, and they aren't useless here — the emulator
# releases the GVL around a frame, so the emulator-backed test files genuinely
# overlap under a thread pool. But most of this suite is reading Wolfenstein's own
# files and building cartridges out of what it finds, which is pure Ruby and would
# still crawl one test at a time. So: processes. They parallelize all of it, and
# hand each shard a clean slate, with no shared constants and no shared emulator
# core.
#
# The output problem processes normally create is N runs' worth of banners, dot
# streams and summaries stapled together. The fix is to stop letting the
# children print at all: each installs a reporter that streams structured
# records back over fd 3, and the parent renders one dot stream, one numbered
# failure list, one summary. Anything a child writes to stdout or stderr on its
# own — a stray puts, a segfault in libmgba — is captured separately and shown
# only when there's something to show.
#
# This file is both halves: required by the Rakefile for the parent side, run as
# a script for the child side.
